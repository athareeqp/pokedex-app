This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- @vitejs/plugin-react uses Babel for Fast Refresh
- @vitejs/plugin-react-swc uses SWC for Fast Refresh

To run the app when developing, make sure to install the necessary tools, such as:

- npm install react-router-dom react-redux
- npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap
- npm install use-local-storage
- npm install axios
